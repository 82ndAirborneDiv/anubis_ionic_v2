        <span class="section-paragraph">
          <p>CDC does not collect any personal information when you use CDC’s digital media from your computer or mobile device unless you choose to provide that information. The CDC privacy policy is as follows:</p>
        </span>
        <span class="section-title">Visits to CDC.gov:</span>
        <span class="section-paragraph">While using the CDC’s digital media, certain information will be gathered and stored about your usage of the digital media. This information does not identify you personally. We collect and store only the following information:
          <ul style=" margin-left: 30px;">
            <li>The Internet domain name (for example, "xcompany.com" if a private Internet access account is used, or "schoolname.edu" if connecting from a university’s domain) and IP address (an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to a device when surfing the web);</li>
            <li>Information about your computer or mobile device (e.g., type and version of web browser, operating system, screen resolution, and connection speed);</li>
            <li>The number of times CDC’s digital media was accessed.</li>
            <li>The pages or screens accessed or visited on CDC’s digital media &nbsp;</li>
            <li>The visit date and time;</li>
            <li>If www.cdc.gov is designated as a home page (in the event your mobile device allows this functionality); and</li>
            <li>The internet address or URL of the website visited immediately prior to visiting CDC’s digital media, if you connect to CDC.gov via a link from another web page.</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <p>Collection and analysis of this information in the aggregate will help us enhance performance of our digital media, improve informational materials available through digital media, and improve overall customer service.</p>
        <h3>Use of Cookies</h3>
        <p>CDC also uses web measurements and customization technologies (such as "cookies").
          You can choose not to accept cookies from any website, including cdc.gov, by changing your browser settings.

        <h3>Using CDC’s Mobile Applications</h3>
          <p>When you use CDC’s Mobile Applications (Apps), certain information will be gathered and stored about your usage of the App. This information does not identify you personally. We collect and store information as follows:</p>
          <ul style="margin-left: 30px;">
            <li>CDC receives aggregate data about the use of our Apps, such as the number of times the applications have been opened or the interactions or actions completed in the application. This is gathered via a third party provider (<a role="link" href="/other/third-party-pages.html">please refer to the tools list</a>). We also receive aggregate data from the platforms that distribute our Apps (currently the iTunes Store, Google Play Store, and the Windows Store), such as the number of people who download the App and mobile set-up information (e.g., device model, App version, country, language, and mobile carrier). Please consult the privacy policies of these third parties for further information. </li>
            <li>You may sign up to receive “push notification” messages via a third party provider (<a role="link" href="/other/third-party-pages.html">please refer to the tools list</a>). To make sure messages reach the correct devices, our third party provider relies on a <a role="link" href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/privacy#device">device token</a> unique to your mobile device. A device token is a unique identifier issued to the app by the operating system of the mobile device. While we may be able to access a list of the tokens, the App and tokens do not reveal your identity, unique device ID, or contact information to us. The third party provider may collect the following: the time of an event, how a User came to our site, what search engine and search keywords users may have used to get to our site, information about the device our user is on such as their Operating System, and browser, as well as the city, region and country location of users. This location information enables CDC to send public health push notification messages that are relevant to certain geographic locations. If, at any time, you wish to stop receiving push notifications, simply adjust your phone settings or remove the App.</li>
          </ul>
          <p> </p>
          <p>CDC does not disclose, share, sell, or transfer any information about CDC digital media visitors or users unless required for law enforcement or otherwise required by law.</p>
          <p>For site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains available to all users, CDC employs software programs to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage.</p>
          <p>CDC’s digital media are maintained by the U.S. Government and is protected by various provisions of Title 18, U.S. Code. Violations of Title 18 are subject to criminal prosecution in Federal court.</p>

          <h3>Children and Privacy on CDC.gov</h3>
          <p>We believe in the importance of protecting the privacy of children online. The <a role="link" href="http://www.business.ftc.gov/privacy-and-security/childrens-privacy">Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)</a> governs information gathered online from or about children under the age of 13. Verifiable consent from a child’s parent or guardian is required before collecting, using, or disclosing personal information from a child under age 13. Our digital media is not intended to solicit information of any kind from children under age 13.
