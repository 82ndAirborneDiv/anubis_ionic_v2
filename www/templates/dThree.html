        Dementia may be reported as the underlying cause of death in Part I or as a contributing cause in Part II.
        When reporting dementia as a cause of death, please specify the type of dementia (e.g., Alzheimerâ€™s disease,
        vascular dementia, Lewy Body dementia, etc.).  If a specific diagnosis is not definitive, but is suspected or likely, then it is appropriate to qualify the diagnosis as "possible," "probable," or "presumed."
