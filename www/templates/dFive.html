    When reporting drug-related deaths, always specify the substance or substances involved.
    If multiple drugs are involved, be sure to name each drug. Please do <u>not</u> report brand names.
    Verify the spelling of each drug.
    If a specific drug could not be determined, report the class of drug, if possible.
    Avoid broad terms like "drug," "medicine," "multidrug," "polysubstances," or "polypharmacy," if possible.
    In the case of a drug overdose or poisoning, the medical examiner or coroner should be contacted. To see an example,
